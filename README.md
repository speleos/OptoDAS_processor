# OptoDAS_processor
Tools to automate the processing of OptoDAS datasets


## Usage

There are two configuration files:

- *sources_list.py*, where the events and processing steps are defined

Here is a commented example entry:

```
sources = {
    # Name of the event. It is also used for filenames of saved data and figures.
    "MSEED_20231028-30_A": {

        # The event time
        "start_time": '2023-10-28 00:00:00.0',

        # Only needed if running time lapses
        "end_time": '2023-10-31 00:00:00.0',

        # Used when processing earthquake data
        "magnitude": 2.3,

        # Coordinates are used to calculate theoretical travel times
        "latitude": 31.51,                     #                                                                                                                                           "longitude": -16.21,                   #                                                                                                                                           "depth": 0.0,

        # Processing type: If 'seismic' the processor assumes that start_time is event time
        # and will calculate the travel time to select the appropriate data
        # Other defined types are 'spectrogram', 'whales', 'spectrogram_currents'
        "type": 'seismic',

        # Available modes are 'time_lapse', which applies the processing chain as many times
        # as needed between 'start_time' and 'end_time', and 'seismic', which uses 'start_time'
        # and 'window_duration'
        "mode": 'time_lapse',

        # Defines how much time before the event should be loaded
        "window_in": 0,

        # How much data should be loaded
        "window_duration": 3600,

        # Set to True for local and regional seismic events
        "local": True,

        # Indicate if precise timing is available, and apply a clock correction if needed.
        # It will be checked upon data loading.
        "GPS": True,

        # Which channels to load, taken from a dictionary called channel_ranges
        "channel_ranges": 'mseed_A',

        # Where the raw data is to be found or saved.
        # This overrides any path definitions in shared_config.py
        "DAS_data_path": '/mnt/data/S3-test',

        # Where miniSEED files are to be saved. Also overrides previously-defined paths.
        "mseed_output_path": '/mnt/data/02_MSEED/hourly_mseed',

        # The operations to perform after loading the data, in the order they should be performed.
        "process_chain": [
            {
                # The available operations are the functions in processor.py
                "operation": 'decimate_dfdas',
                # The parameters are also the ones defined for each function.
                # Parameters will be matched to the function.
                "params": {"factors": [2]}
            },
            {
                # Multiple invocations of the same function are possible
                "operation": 'dfdas_to_mseed',
                # in this case, the first invocation produces a single miniSEED
                # file with as many traces as loaded DAS channels
                "params": {"write": 'stream'}
            },
            {
                "operation": 'dfdas_to_mseed',
                # in the second invocation, one file per channel will be saved
                # if 'write' is set to false, no files are written, and only the OBSpy Stream() is created
                "params": {"write": 'channels'}
            },
        ]
    },
}
```

- *shared_config.py*, where general parameters that modify funcion behaviour are defined.


The example script shows how to run two separate processing chains. The first will download example data from GEOFON. The second will automatically convert the data into MSEED in hourly files.

## Baleen whale detector
There is also a baleen whale detector based on template matching that can be run separately after data has been loaded and converted to Stream() using the dfdas_to_mseed function (even with write set to False).

## Dispersion curves fit
The dispersion curves example needs a single 30-minute hdf5 file, downsampled to 1 Hz. The file can be assembled from the individual 10-seconds files and decimated using DAS_processor.

## Whale locator
The script needs a 60-seconds Stream() of the entire cable, decimated to 100 Hz. The script can read a miniSEED file, or use DAS_processor to load raw DAS data, decimate it, and converted it to Stream().
